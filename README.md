## Installation
Most of the installation steps are the same on all platforms:
* Install a version of a Python interpreter using your method of choice (see Python's [beginner's guide to installing Python](https://wiki.python.org/moin/BeginnersGuide/Download) for info)
* Install a C/C++ compiler, for using Cython:
    * On Windows this is usually included in the Visual Studio Community Edition (see downloads [here](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/community/)), then select the C++ Development Kit during installation and it should be good to go
    * On Mac and Linux this usually comes prepackaged

* Install Git on your platform (see official documentation and install guides here [here](https://git-scm.com))
* **On CUDA-enabled machines:** Install a recent (12.x) version of Nvidia's CUDA Toolkit for GPU processing and segmentation
* On your machine, create and activate a [Python virtual environment](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html) using your method of choice
* Download the archive and move it to the virtual environment folder

* Use the command:
 ```
 pip install <archive-name>
```
* Wait for the process to finish, then type '**startGUI**' to start the application.
